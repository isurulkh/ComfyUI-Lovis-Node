# Audio processing libraries for AudioDurationNode
# Install at least one of these for audio duration analysis:

# Option 1: librosa (recommended for audio analysis, more accurate)
librosa>=0.10.0

# Option 2: pydub (alternative, supports more audio formats)
pydub>=0.25.0

# Note: You only need one of the above libraries, but having both provides
# better compatibility and fallback options.
